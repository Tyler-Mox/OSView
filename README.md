OSView is a web application that displays the wait times for various restaurants and bars within a 2 mile radius of Ohio State. The app is user driven, that is when users are waiting in line at a location, they enter the approximate wait time. Other users have the capability to rate this wait time in terms of how accurate it was. A user points system is also proposed so the more activity a user has, the higher the rank they are.
