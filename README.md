OSView is a web application that displays the wait times for various restaurants and bars within a 2 mile radius of Ohio State. The app is user driven, that is when users are waiting in line at a location, they enter the approximate wait time. Other users have the capability to rate this wait time in terms of how accurate it is. A user points system is also proposed so the more active a user is, the more experience they earn, leading to a higher rank.

Potential Future Improvements: Add the opportunity for users to earn coupons to their favorite locations as they increase their rank. Refine the points system and add incentive for users to use the app.
